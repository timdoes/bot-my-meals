# Saved meals

Household-shared pool. One row per dinner the house wants again. It is not a private shelf and not a promise that every saved meal appears every week.

Cool-down is **21 days (3 weeks)** after `last_locked_at` — the last time that dinner was on a **locked** week — before a random ballot may suggest it again. Saving does not start the clock. **Request for next week** sets `requested_for_week` and bypasses cool-down for that week.

The app does not invent a second waiting screen. **Request for next week** always targets the planning week. If that row is missing, `request_saved_for_planning` creates it (one next week only). **People per night** first (optional **Special instructions** on the same step; empty OK) is saved before that week’s ballot is queued. Prefill from House defaults; Save needs plates above zero on at least one night. If people are already saved, Request queues the ballot for that `starts_on`. If a planning week already exists, Request attaches to that week. It will not open a week after next. Saved → **Request for next week** stays its own path. A future swipe from This week starts **Next week** when that week does not exist yet, lands on **Next week**, and shows People per night first. It will not invent a third open week. Toast after swipe-create: **Next week started. Set people per night.** Cool-down is unchanged — Request still bypasses it. Explicit requests ride that week’s `ballot_requests` inbox (`saved_recipe_keys`) once the ballot exists. A request already aimed at the planning week shows **Requested** until it is consumed or the week advances. Copy stays **Request for next week** / **Requested for next week.** — do not say this week. House People per night stays the template for new weeks only.

## Table `public.saved_meals`

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `household_id` | House. Either voter (owner or voter) may insert, update, or delete. Every member may read. |
| `recipe_key` | Stable identity. `recipes.recipe_key` when Meal Ops stamped one, otherwise the normalized title (trim, lower case, collapsed spaces). Unique per household. |
| `title` | Latest title the house should see. |
| `saved_at` | When someone saved it. Sort the manage list by this, newest first. |
| `last_locked_at` | The dinner's night on a locked week, stored as noon in the house timezone. Null until then, so an unlocked save can be suggested sooner. Not the moment the week was locked. |
| `requested_for_week` | `weeks.starts_on` the house asked for. Null if not requested. |
| `source_recipe_id` | Recipe row at save time. Set null if that recipe is deleted. Not a forever copy of the steps. |

Row Level Security: household members `select`. Owner and voter `insert` / `update` / `delete`. Service role bypasses RLS.

A week transitioning to `locked` stamps `last_locked_at` from that dinner's `night_date` (noon in the house timezone) for saved keys that match a real dinner that night (not leftovers, not remove / skip / request-new). Saving a dinner on an already locked week stores that same night. Matching dinners on `requested_for_week` clear the request.

## How Meal Ops reads the pool

Service role, for one household:

```sql
select recipe_key, title, saved_at, last_locked_at, requested_for_week, source_recipe_id
from public.saved_meals
where household_id = $household
order by saved_at desc;
```

Explicit asks for a week (include these even inside cool-down):

```sql
select recipe_key, title, source_recipe_id
from public.saved_meals
where household_id = $household
  and requested_for_week = $week_starts_on;
```

Random pool (no outstanding request, and either never locked or last lock at least 21 days ago):

```sql
select recipe_key, title, source_recipe_id
from public.saved_meals
where household_id = $household
  and requested_for_week is null
  and (last_locked_at is null or last_locked_at <= now() - interval '21 days');
```

The same split is `ballot_role` on `public.saved_meal_pool(target_starts date)` for a signed-in household member (`requested`, `pool`, or `cooldown`).

When an Admin creates or refreshes a week’s meals, `request_week_ballot(target_starts)` copies keys for **that** week (this week when `target_starts` is omitted, next week when planning). `plan_next_week()` creates the planning row if needed and does not queue its ballot until People per night is saved. It will not open a week after next.

`save_planning_people` writes `weeks.night_headcounts` and optional `weeks.special_instructions` (also copied onto `ballot_requests.special_instructions`). Empty instructions are fine. That save does not change `households.night_headcounts`. Run `supabase/migrations/20260928233000_planning_people_gate.sql` after the planning-week migration. Weeks that already had meals or a ballot are marked confirmed so they skip the gate.

- `ballot_requests.saved_recipe_keys` — `requested_for_week` equals that week’s `starts_on` (include these; cool-down does not apply)
- `ballot_requests.saved_pool_keys` — saved meals with no outstanding request whose `last_locked_at` is null or at least 21 days ago (optional random sample, not a promise)

A pending ballot’s `saved_recipe_keys` updates when a voter requests or removes. `saved_pool_keys` is a snapshot from propose time. The live pool is still `saved_meals`.

## Writing the dinner back

Set `recipes.recipe_key` to the pool’s `recipe_key` on the new week’s recipe. The title key still matches if the title is unchanged and no stamp was stored. Use `source_recipe_id` only while that recipe row still exists. Do not invent grocery prices or cart claims from this pool.
